Consider the heat equation $-\Delta T = 0$ on the domain $D$ meshed in the
file `meshDataHoleS5.m` (see Figure 1). Let us define the __interior
boundary__ $C$, as the small circumference inside the domain and the
__exterior boundary__ $E$ as the remaining part of the boundary of the
boundary of $D$ (i.e. $E = \partial\Omega\setminus C$). We also consider
$L$, the left part of $E$, that is,
